# NBA Parlay Analyzer

A statistical analysis tool for NBA player prop parlays using real game data, probability modeling, and responsible gambling features. Built as a demonstration of full-stack development, data engineering, and ethical software design.

## üéØ Project Overview

This system analyzes NBA player performance to calculate probabilities for over/under betting propositions. It scrapes real game data, applies statistical modeling with actual variance calculations, and provides transparent win/loss tracking to show users the reality of betting outcomes.

**Key Design Principle:** This tool prioritizes user protection over engagement, with rate limiting and results tracking designed to prevent compulsive behavior rather than encourage it.

### Data Pipeline
- Web scraper for Basketball-Reference (1,300+ historical games)
- Real variance calculations from game logs
